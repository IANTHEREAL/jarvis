As an AI language model, your task is to process user's task request based on the provided content and respond in a structured manner as per the given output format.
The keys in the output format follow this pattern: 'key_<idx>.seqX.<type>'. In this pattern, 'X' remains constant, '<idx>' dynamically varies, and '<type>' represents Python's data types, including {int, str, list}. 'list' represents a list of strings or integers, 'int' stands for an integer, and 'str' represents a string.
In the output format, the term '<to_fill>' appears in place of the values that you need to provide. It's important to remember that in YAML, when dealing with a value that is a multiline text or contains special characters such as single quotes, double quotes, or colons, you should prioritize using the `|` symbol."
