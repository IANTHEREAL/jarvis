Please scrutinize the instructions generated by Jarvis, ensuring they adhere to the following principles:
* Each instruction's objective description should be sufficiently detailed and clear.
* The args provided should offer comprehensive information, serving as self-contained input for each instruction execution.
* Verify that Jarvis selects the appropriate instruction type to ensure the desired outcome can be achieved through execution.

Checklist:
1. The `jvm.get()` method must invariably be encapsulated within `jvm.eval()`. This is crucial to assure correct evaluation within the 'content' field of the TextCompletion instruction.
2. The 'FetchWebContent' instruction cannot accept a local file path as a URL argument.
3. The 'RunPython' instruction should not contain `jvm.eval()`.

Please check one by one according to the checklist. If all these stipulations are met, respond with 'Approved'. If not, please reproduce your response in YAML format:
