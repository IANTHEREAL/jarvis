Review Requirement:
Inspect each generated JVM instruction one by one, focusing on input arguments (args). If 'jvm.get()' or 'jvm.list_values_with_key_prefix()' are used, they must be evaluated with 'jvm.eval()'. Otherwise, 'jvm.eval()' isn't needed. However, no nested 'jvm.eval()' is allowed. For 'RunPython', don't use 'jvm.eval()' in generated Python code.

The main goal is to avoid direct invocation of 'jvm.xxx()' within args per JVM specification. Incorrect usage could cause runtime errors or unexpected behaviors.
