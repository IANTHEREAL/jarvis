Jarvis, I need you to locate all test case files in the 't' subdirectory within the 'mysql-test' directory that start with 'sp'. Directly convert these test case files into a format that can be used for testing with the TiDB database. Note that TiDB does not support stored procedures syntax such as 'create procedure', 'call procedure', 'drop procedure', 'UNTIL ... END', 'REPEAT', and 'WHILE ... END'.

Modify any test cases that cannot be directly converted to match the functionality and syntax of TiDB. For each converted test case, create a corresponding result file in the 'r' subdirectory.

Finally, save the converted test cases and their corresponding result files into a new 'tidb-test' directory in the current working directory. Ensure the 'tidb-test' directory also has a 't' subdirectory for the test cases and an 'r' subdirectory for the result files, similar to the structure of the 'mysql-test' directory.
